### List

Wrapper class to provide functional way of handling arrays. Borrowed some ideas of Streams in Java 8.

| Method                                  | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `List(array)`                           | constructor | Creates new List instance from specified array                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `numberRange(from: number, to: number)` | static      | Creates a new List instance, with generated numbers from specified range                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `from(index: number)`                   | specifier   | Defines starting index for a range. Collectors' and filters' target maybe narrowed by specifiers, ie. you can have an array of 10 items, but you want to target a certain range of it for filtering and collecting (via specifier functions) |
| `to(index: number)`                     | specifier   | Defines ending index for a range. Collectors' and filters' target maybe narrowed by specifiers, ie. you can have an array of 10 items, but you want to target a certain range of it for filtering and collecting (via specifier functions)   |
| `filter(fn)`                            | filter      | Adds a filter function to pending filters. Filter function needs to return boolean to define which objects to filter out from `collect()` results. All filters are executed in order they are added, when `collect()` is called              |
| `collect()`                             | collector   | Executes all pending filters, and returns filtered list as an array                                                                                                                                                                          |


## Usage

```js
import { List } from 'bottomscore'
const instance = new List([0,1,2,3])
const results = instance.filter(number => number > 1).filter(number => number < 3).collect()
```
